# Advanced TensorFlow
Collection of (Little More) Advanced TensorFlow Implementations.

Try my best to implement algorithms with a single Jupyter Notebook.

1. Deep Convolutional GAN with MNIST from [carpedm20](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow).
2. Char-RNN with Linux Kernel Codes from [sjchoi86](https://github.com/sjchoi86/Tensorflow-101).
3. Super Resolution with GAN from [srez](https://github.com/david-gpu/srez).
4. MNIST 99.59% with tf-slim from [hwalsuklee](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/tensorflow-mnist-cnn)
